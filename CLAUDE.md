## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

**Cortina** is a Professional Services Management Platform (PSMP) — a single connected
system built specifically for boutique consulting firms that bill by the hour, manage by
the project, and grow by the person. It is the internal operational backbone for professional
services firms, tracking every engagement from earliest pursuit through final invoice and
collections.

Cortina is a companion product to Vetta (external-facing project management) and
is sold alongside Vetta as part of a suite of tools for owner's rep and consulting firms.
It is built as a universal commercial product — not for any specific firm.

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE:**
Cortina must never reference any specific firm by name in code, UI, or data. All
firm-specific information (name, logo, address, branding, rates, codes) lives in
firm_settings and flows from there. The first firm to use Cortina is simply the first
customer — the product is built for any professional services consulting firm. This
is the same philosophy as Vetta. Enforce this in every component and every session
without exception.

**The core problem it solves:**
Owner's rep and consulting firms manage projects, fees, people, time, and billing across
fragmented tools — spreadsheets, QuickBooks, generic PSA platforms — none of which are
built for this specific business model. Cortina replaces all of them with one integrated platform.

**Product family:**
- Collina — household budget app (separate repo)
- Vetta — client-facing project management (separate repo)
- Cortina — internal practice management / PSMP (this repo)
- Alta•Via — institutional knowledge platform, AI-powered (future, separate product)
- Archivio — qualifications & BD database (future, concept only)

**The suite sales motion:**
Vetta is sold first (project management). Cortina is the natural second conversation
(how are you managing time, billing, and firm performance?). Alta•Via is the third
(institutional knowledge, lessons learned, SOPs). Each product stands alone but they
share project and client data as a connected ecosystem.

## 2. BRAND & DESIGN SYSTEM

### 2.1 Brand Identity

**Product name:** Cortina
- The dot separator is intentional — it makes the two-word name easier to read
  and less likely to be mispronounced
- Drop the dot only in plain text contexts where it may cause issues
- Always render as CORTINA in the wordmark (all caps)

**Mark:** Angular AV mountain mark with orange sun accent
- The A (mountain peak) and V (descending valley) in the mark are geometric mirrors
- The same mirror logic appears in the CORTINA wordmark — A and V are mirrors
- This is an intentional, layered brand decision — preserve it in all UI treatments
- The mark encodes the initials AV for Cortina while reading as a mountain landscape

**Typography:** Geometric sans serif — Futura or equivalent
- All-caps wordmark
- The V/A geometric mirror is most pronounced in Futura — preserve this
- Identify exact font from generated assets and license appropriately

**Logo files:** To be added to /public/assets/ when finalized by designer
- The AI-generated marks are directionally correct but need vector refinement
- Do not use AI-generated marks in production — placeholder only until designer delivers

### 2.2 Color System

**Primary color:** Forest Green #1E3D2F
**Accent color:** Orange #F2903A

**Sidebar:**
- Background: #1E3D2F (forest green)
- Text active: #FFFFFF
- Text inactive: rgba(255,255,255,0.6)
- Active item highlight: slightly lighter green background + #F2903A icon

**Content area:**
- Page background: #F8F9FA (near white)
- Card/panel background: #FFFFFF
- Primary text: #1A1A2E (near black)
- Secondary text: #6B7280
- Border/divider: #E5E7EB
- Table header background: #F3F4F6

**Accent usage — CRITICAL:**
Orange #F2903A is a signal color, not a base color. It appears in:
- The sun accent in the Cortina logo mark
- The active navigation item icon in the sidebar
- Primary CTA buttons
- Key highlight moments (alerts, warnings, critical actions)

Orange must NOT appear in:
- Chart bars or data visualizations
- Body text accents or callouts
- Card icons
- Secondary links or navigation

**Data visualization colors:**
- Primary data bars/lines: #2D5A3D (mid forest green)
- Secondary/actual bars: #D1D5DB (light gray)
- Success/positive: #10B981 (green)
- Warning: #F59E0B (amber)
- Error/alert: #EF4444 (red)
- Neutral: #6B7280 (gray)

**Staffing & Utilization grid colors:**
- Future month, at or above target: #10B981 (green)
- Future month, below target: #EF4444 (red)
- Future month, no projection: #E5E7EB (gray)
- Past month, actual ≥ projected: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Past month, actual < projected: #F59E0B (amber)
- Past month pending close: muted blue/amber with indicator dot
- Current month: progress indicator

**Status colors:**
- Active / Approved / Paid: #10B981 (green)
- Pending / In Review: #F59E0B (amber)
- Overdue / Missing / Error: #EF4444 (red)
- Draft / Inactive: #6B7280 (gray)
- On Hold: #8B5CF6 (purple)

### 2.3 UI Design Principles

**Professional tool — not consumer app:**
- Users are experienced construction professionals
- Data density is appropriate and expected — these are not simplified dashboards
- No rounded pill buttons, pastel colors, or playful micro-animations
- Tables, grids, and structured data are primary UI patterns — embrace them
- Think: Bloomberg Terminal meets modern SaaS — not Mint or Robinhood

**Relationship to Vetta:**
- Same sidebar navigation structure and general layout skeleton
- Same color palette applied with the same logic
- Different enough to be distinct — primarily through content density
  and module-specific UI patterns (timesheets, fee builder, AR aging grid)
- A user of both products should immediately recognize the family relationship

**Navigation structure:**
- Fixed left sidebar, #142538 background
- Cortina logo mark + wordmark at top of sidebar
- Module navigation items below
- Main content area to the right — white/near-white background
- Top bar: breadcrumb + user menu + notifications

**Sidebar navigation — collapsible sections:**

CRM (section header):
- Clients & Contacts → /clients (BUILT)
- BD & Pursuits → /bd (Coming Soon)

Projects (section header):
- Contract → /contracts (Coming Soon)
- Fee Development → /fees (BUILT)
- Billing → /billing (Coming Soon)
- Accounts Receivable → /ar (Coming Soon)

Employee (section header):
- Timecards → /timesheets (Coming Soon)
- PTO Management → /pto (Coming Soon)
- Expense Reports → /expenses (Coming Soon)
- Utilization Projection → /utilization (Coming Soon)
- CV / Talent Profile → /cv (Coming Soon)
- Performance Evaluations → /performance (Coming Soon)

Management (section header):
- Rate Builder → /rate-builder (Coming Soon)
- Employee Management → /employee-management (Coming Soon)
- Profit & Margins → /profit (Coming Soon)
- Staff Utilization → /staff-utilization (Coming Soon)
- Project Financials → /project-financials (Coming Soon)
- Firm Expenses → /firm-expenses (Coming Soon)
- EBITDA Dashboard → /ebitda (Coming Soon)
- Management Visibility → /management (Coming Soon)

Section headers are collapsible. All sections default to collapsed on load.
Built modules use NavLink with active styling.
Coming Soon modules are non-interactive with text-white/30 cursor-not-allowed.
Module items have pl-5 indent and bg-white/8 background (lighter than sidebar).

**Touch-first for timesheet module:**
- Timesheet entry is the primary iPad use case
- Tap targets minimum 44×44px
- No hover-dependent interactions in timesheet UI
- Readable at arm's length
- Cell selection via tap, not click-and-drag

### 2.4 Responsive Design — MANDATORY

**This is a responsive-first build. No exceptions.**

Cortina will be used on:
- Desktop (primary for fee development, invoicing, reporting)
- iPad (primary for timesheet entry — treat as equal priority to desktop)
- Mobile (secondary — at minimum timesheets must work on mobile)

**Responsive requirements:**
- Every component must be built with mobile/tablet breakpoints from day one
- Do not build desktop-only components and retrofit responsiveness later
- Tailwind breakpoint usage: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Sidebar collapses to bottom nav or hamburger on mobile
- Tables must be scrollable horizontally on small screens
- Timesheet grid specifically must be touch-optimized

**iPad app path:**
The React + Vite + Tailwind web app can be wrapped with Capacitor to produce
a native iPad app with minimal additional work. Build responsively now so that
path stays open. Do not make architectural decisions that would prevent this.

**Lesson from Vetta:**
Vetta accumulated responsive debt by not building mobile-first from day one.
Cortina must not repeat this. If a component is not responsive when it is
first built, it is not complete.

---

## 3. TECH STACK

**Frontend:** React 18 + Vite
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS — responsive-first, every component
**Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
**Auth:** Supabase Auth
**Hosting:** Vercel
**Version Control:** GitHub
**Package Manager:** npm
**State Management:** React Context — from day one, no prop drilling ever
**PDF Generation:** To be selected at build time (react-pdf or @react-pdf/renderer)
**Email:** To be selected at build time (Resend recommended)
**Future native app:** Capacitor (for iPad App Store packaging)

**Supabase Project ID:** [UPDATE AFTER SETUP]
**Supabase Project URL:** [UPDATE AFTER SETUP]
**GitHub Repo:** [UPDATE AFTER SETUP]

### Development Conventions

- One file at a time — complete and confirm before moving to next
- Screenshot confirmation before proceeding to next component
- Git commits after each working feature — never commit broken code
- .env file must never be committed — add to .gitignore on day one
- Run git commands in a separate terminal from the dev server
- Every component built responsive from first commit — not as a retrofit
- No inline styles — Tailwind classes only
- React Context for all shared state — no prop drilling
- Supabase RLS enforced at database level for all sensitive tables

### File Structure Convention
```
/src
  /components
    /layout        — Sidebar, TopBar, PageWrapper
    /ui            — Button, Input, Table, Modal, Badge (reusable primitives)
    /clients       — Client-specific components
    /projects      — Project-specific components
    /fees          — Fee development components
    /rates         — Rate card components
    /timesheets    — Timesheet components
    /invoicing     — Invoice and AR components
  /context         — React Context providers
  /hooks           — Custom hooks
  /lib             — supabase.js client, utilities
  /pages           — Top-level page components
/public
  /assets          — Logo files, icons
```

---

## 4. USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS

## 5. BUILD PHASES

### Module Architecture — Four Sections

**CRM:**
- C1 — Clients & Contacts
- C2 — BD / Pursuits

**Projects:**
- P1 — Contract (includes change orders, add services)
- P2 — Fee Development (scope-based, hours-based, target fee, Exhibit A)
- P3 — Billing / Invoicing
- P4 — Accounts Receivable

**Employee:**
- E1 — Timecards
- E2 — PTO Management (requests, accrual tracking, manager approval)
- E3 — Expense Reports (hard attachment requirement, attendee list for meals)
- E4 — Utilization Projection (own view only)
- E5 — CV / Talent Profile (auto-populated from completed projects, resume generator)
- E6 — Performance Evaluations (TBD — process not yet defined)

**Management:**
- M1 — Rate Builder (title stacks, burden calculation, health check dashboard)
- M2 — Employee Management (compensation, benefits, PTO tiers, published rates)
- M3 — Profit & Margins (per-employee health check, actual vs modeled)
- M4 — Staff Utilization Projection (firm-wide grid, allocation management)
- M5 — Project Financials (firm-level dashboard, drillable to project)
- M6 — Firm Expenses (overhead: rent, software, insurance — separate from E3)
- M7 — EBITDA Dashboard (terminal reporting layer)
- M8 — Management Visibility / Unified Approval Queue

**External:**
- Xero — bidirectional accounting integration (future v2)

**Future standalone product:**
- Alta•Via — institutional knowledge platform (lessons learned, SOPs, contract mods, AI-powered)

### Access Tiers

**Employee** — Employee section only
**Manager** — Employee + CRM + Projects (sees all employees in firm grid, edits direct reports only)
**Principal** — Full access including Management section

Direct reports configured via manager_id on users table.
Determines approval routing for timesheets, expenses, PTO, staffing allocations.

### Build Sequence

**Phase 1 — Core (Sessions 1-5, current):**
Client Records → Projects → Fee Development → Rate Cards → Timesheets → Invoicing & AR

**Phase 2 — Intelligence Layer (next):**
Financial Projections, Staffing & Utilization, Expense Reports

**Phase 3 — Front End:**
Full CRM & Pipeline, Rate Development Tool (M1)

**Phase 4 — Infrastructure:**
User Roles & Permissions full UI, Reporting & Dashboard

---

## 6. MODULE SPECS — PHASE 1

---

### 6.1 CLIENT RECORDS (Simplified CRM)

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all client information.
Referenced by Projects, Contracts, and Invoicing. Data entered once, flows everywhere.
Never re-enter client data anywhere else in Cortina.

**clients table:**
```sql
client_id         uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
company_name      text NOT NULL
client_type       enum('Owner','Developer','Nonprofit','Government','Other')
billing_address   text
billing_city      text
billing_state     text
billing_zip       text
payment_terms     enum('Net 30','Net 45','Net 60','Due on Receipt') default 'Net 30'
is_nonprofit      boolean default false  -- triggers nonprofit discount eligibility
notes             text
created_at        timestamptz default now()
updated_at        timestamptz default now()
created_by        uuid FK → auth.users
```

**client_contacts table:**
```sql
contact_id           uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
client_id            uuid FK → clients NOT NULL
first_name           text NOT NULL
last_name            text NOT NULL
title                text
email                text
phone                text
is_primary_billing   boolean default false
is_invoice_recipient boolean default false  -- appears in invoice To: field
is_cc_recipient      boolean default false  -- appears in invoice CC: field
notes                text
is_active            boolean default true
created_at           timestamptz default now()
```

**UI:**
- Client list: searchable by name/type, sortable, paginated
- Client detail: all fields + linked projects list + contacts list
- Inline add/edit for contacts within client detail view
- Soft delete only — never hard delete client records

---

### 6.2 PROJECTS

**Purpose:** The master record. Every other module references a project.
Nothing in Cortina exists without a project anchor.

**projects table:**
```sql
project_id                 uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
project_number             text UNIQUE NOT NULL  -- auto-generated per firm rules
project_name               text NOT NULL
client_id                  uuid FK → clients NOT NULL
project_type               enum('Healthcare','Performing Arts','Education',
                           'Commercial','Residential','Government','Mixed Use','Other')
status                     enum('Pursuit','Active','On Hold','Complete','Lost','Cancelled')
                           default 'Pursuit'
principal_in_charge        uuid FK → auth.users
project_manager            uuid FK → auth.users
description                text
-- Timeline
projected_start_date       date
projected_end_date         date
actual_start_date          date
actual_end_date            date
current_phase              enum('Predevelopment','Design','Procurement',
                           'Construction','Closeout','Complete')
-- Financial (populated from Fee Development on contract execution — then locked)
contracted_fee             decimal(12,2)
fee_method                 enum('Scope-Based','Hours-Based','Target-Fee')
billing_method             enum('Time-and-Materials','Monthly-Fixed',
                           'Milestone','Percent-Complete')
invoice_detail_level       enum('Summary','By-Employee','By-Employee-with-Descriptions')
                           default 'By-Employee'
payment_terms              enum('Net 30','Net 45','Net 60','Due on Receipt')
add_services_threshold_pct decimal(5,2) default 80.00  -- warn at 80% fee burn
po_number                  text
-- Contract
contract_type              enum('AIA','Custom-PSA','Other')
contract_executed_date     date
contract_document_url      text
-- Metadata
created_at                 timestamptz default now()
updated_at                 timestamptz default now()
created_by                 uuid FK → auth.users
```

**project_team_assignments table:**
```sql
assignment_id    uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
project_id       uuid FK → projects NOT NULL
user_id          uuid FK → auth.users NOT NULL
role_on_project  text
start_date       date
end_date         date
is_active        boolean default true
created_at       timestamptz default now()
```

**Project Numbering Rules (stored in firm_settings):**
- Firm configures prefix, year inclusion, and sequential format
- Example: PMG-2026-001 or HC-2026-001 (type-coded prefix)
- Auto-generates on project creation — never manual, never reused
- Sequential number resets per year or runs continuously — firm choice

**Project Status Flow:**
```
Pursuit → Active → On Hold / Complete / Cancelled / Lost
```

**HARD GATE — project cannot move to Active without:**
1. fee_records record with status = 'Executed'
2. staffing_projections record with status = 'Baseline' and locked_at NOT NULL
3. System enforces this as a database-level check — not just UI validation

---

### 6.3 FEE DEVELOPMENT

**Purpose:** Build, compare, and execute project fees using three methods.
The executed fee version becomes the immutable financial baseline for all downstream
modules — projections, invoicing, add services warnings, financial reporting.

**fee_records table:**
```sql
fee_id          uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
project_id      uuid FK → projects NOT NULL
fee_name        text NOT NULL  -- user label: "Scope-Based v1", "Target Fee Option"
method          enum('Scope-Based','Hours-Based-Simple',
                'Hours-Based-Detailed','Target-Fee')
status          enum('Draft','Under-Review','Executed','Superseded') default 'Draft'
total_fee       decimal(12,2)  -- calculated
discounted_fee  decimal(12,2)  -- calculated after discounts applied
notes           text
created_by      uuid FK → auth.users
created_at      timestamptz default now()
updated_at      timestamptz default now()
executed_at     timestamptz  -- set when status → Executed
executed_by     uuid FK → auth.users
```

**Rules:**
- Multiple fee_records allowed per project
- Only ONE fee_record per project may have status = 'Executed' at any time
- On execution: project.contracted_fee = fee.discounted_fee (locked)
- Executed records are IMMUTABLE — no field updates permitted after executed_at is set
- Enforce immutability via RLS policy and application logic

---

#### METHOD 1 — SCOPE-BASED (Bottom Up)

**scope_library table (firm-level master list):**
```sql
scope_item_id              uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
phase                      enum('Preconstruction','Construction')
category                   enum('A-Predevelopment',
                           'B-Design-Consultant-Selection',
                           'C-Contractor-Selection',
                           'D-Preconstruction-Coordination',
                           'E-Other-Vendor-Procurement',
                           'F-Cost-Schedule-Quality',
                           'G-Construction-Phase',
                           'H-Other-Vendors-Construction',
                           'I-Other-Scope')
item_number                text  -- "1", "24", "92" etc.
activity_name              text NOT NULL
standard_description       text
default_unit               enum('ls','ea','wks','mon','hr') default 'ls'
default_role               enum('PM','Contracts','CM','Scheduling',
                           'Sustainability','Custom')
default_participation_level enum('High','Medium','Low') default 'Medium'
is_active                  boolean default true
is_custom                  boolean default false  -- false = PMG default, true = firm-added
sort_order                 integer
created_at                 timestamptz default now()
```

**Pre-load:** 123 line items from PMG Attachment A Scope of Services.
Source file: `PROJECT_NAME_Attachment_A_-_Scope_of_Services_-_Update.xlsx`
Load via seed script. Preserve phase, category, item number, name, description,
unit, and role from source document exactly.

**Participation Level meaning:**
- High: PMG leads — suggest more hours in tooltip
- Medium: PMG supports — suggest moderate hours in tooltip
- Low: PMG monitors — suggest minimal hours in tooltip
Over time, actual hours from timesheets will calibrate these suggestions per item.

**fee_line_items table (Method 1):**
```sql
line_item_id         uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
fee_id               uuid FK → fee_records NOT NULL
scope_item_id        uuid FK → scope_library  -- null for custom items
custom_description   text  -- used when scope_item_id is null
participation_level  enum('High','Medium','Low')  -- overrides library default
unit                 enum('ls','ea','wks','mon','hr')
quantity             decimal(10,2)
hours_per_unit       decimal(10,2)
total_hours          decimal(10,2)  -- calculated: quantity × hours_per_unit
role                 enum('PM','Contracts','CM','Scheduling','Sustainability','Custom')
rate                 decimal(10,2)  -- pulled from rate card at line item creation
line_total           decimal(12,2)  -- calculated: total_hours × rate
sort_order           integer
notes                text
```

**Method 1 UI:**
- Split panel: left = scope library browser (phase → category → items with checkboxes)
- Right = active fee builder showing selected line items
- Grid columns: # | Activity | Participation | Unit | Qty | Hrs/Unit | Total Hrs |
  Role | Rate | Total | Notes | Delete
- Subtotals by phase at bottom, grand total fee
- Custom item: blank row always at bottom of fee builder (same UX as timesheets)
- Participation tooltip: shows suggested hours range for H/M/L for that item

---

#### METHOD 2 — HOURS-BASED

**Simple mode fields (on fee_records):**
```sql
hb_simple_hours_per_month  decimal(10,2)
hb_simple_duration_months  integer
hb_simple_role             enum  -- FK to rate card role
hb_simple_rate             decimal(10,2)
-- total_fee = hours_per_month × duration_months × rate
```

**Detailed mode — Staffing Curve:**
Uses staffing_projections and projection_monthly_detail tables (see Section 6.3 below).
Method 2 Detailed automatically creates and populates the staffing projection.
This is the only method that does so automatically — all others require
manual projection completion before execution is permitted.

---

#### METHOD 3 — TARGET FEE (Reverse Engineer)

**Target fee fields (on fee_records):**
```sql
tf_target_fee           decimal(12,2)  -- the starting constraint
tf_feasibility          enum('Viable','Tight','Below-Cost')  -- system calculated
tf_available_hours      decimal(10,2)  -- system calculated given team + rates
tf_margin_at_target     decimal(5,2)   -- system calculated %
```

UI shows: given this fee, this team, this duration — here is what PMG can deliver,
what the margin is, and whether it is viable.

---

#### BLENDED RATE CALCULATOR (Future — requires P1 Contract and M1 Rate Builder)

Each project can have a blended rate calculated from team composition.
Located in the fee/project header — "Blended Rate" button opens a panel.

Data flow:
M1 Rate Builder → firm-wide standard rates by role
P1 Contract → project-level rate modifications (negotiated rates, overrides)
P2 Fee Development → blended rate calculator uses contract rates as inputs

Calculation: Σ(Role Rate × Role Hours/Week) ÷ Σ(Total Hours/Week) = Blended Rate
Example: Sr. PM $200/hr × 5hrs + PM $170/hr × 30hrs = $6,100 ÷ 35hrs = $174.29/hr

Stored on fee_records. "Blended" option available in Role dropdown on line items.
Build after P1 Contract and M1 Rate Builder exist.

---

#### DURATION INPUTS (Built — Session 5b)

Two duration fields on fee_records (already migrated):
- preconstruction_duration (decimal) + preconstruction_duration_unit (Weeks/Months)
- construction_duration (decimal) + construction_duration_unit (Weeks/Months)

Live in the Fee Summary card, above the line items section.
Scope-Based fees only. Read-only when fee is Executed.

---

#### UNIT OPTIONS (Built — Session 5b)

Four options replacing original ls/ea/wks/mon/hr enum:
- per-week: auto-calculates qty from phase duration, Math.ceil for weeks
- per-month: auto-calculates qty from phase duration
- each: manual qty entry, no duration math
- lump-sum: defaults qty to 1, manual override allowed

qty_override boolean on fee_line_items:
- false: qty shows auto-calculated value (blue field background)
- true: qty shows manual override (amber field background, reset button)
- Reset: clears override, restores auto-calculated value
- Changing unit dropdown clears override flag

---

#### EXHIBIT A EXPORT (Built — Session 5b)

"Print Exhibit A" button on FeeDetail — all fee methods, all statuses.
Opens new browser tab with standalone HTML document.

Shows: scope items by category, hours per item, phase subtotals (fee only)
Hides: per-line rates, per-line dollar totals
Font: Arial. Portrait orientation. Fixed column widths via colgroup.

Future: firm logo auto-populates from firm_settings when that infrastructure exists.

---

#### DISCOUNTS

**fee_discounts table:**
```sql
discount_id          uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
fee_id               uuid FK → fee_records NOT NULL
discount_type        enum('Nonprofit','Lump-Sum-Billing',
                    'Relationship-Discretionary','Rate-Discount')
applied_at           enum('Line-Item','Total-Fee','Hourly-Rate')
discount_amount      decimal(12,2)  -- dollar amount (use one OR the other)
discount_pct         decimal(5,2)   -- percentage (use one OR the other)
notes                text NOT NULL  -- required for all discounts — audit trail
tax_write_off_eligible boolean default false  -- true for Nonprofit type
created_by           uuid FK → auth.users
created_at           timestamptz default now()
```

Discounts display as line items on the fee summary.
Nonprofit discounts generate a separate report for tax/accounting purposes.
discounted_fee on fee_records = total_fee minus all applicable discounts.

---

#### STAFFING PROJECTION (Required Gate — Must Complete Before Execution)

**Three input modes:**

**Straight-Line (Automatic) — always available, one click:**
Enter start_date and end_date. System divides total_fee evenly across all months.
Least accurate but always compliant with the gate requirement.
Can be refined into a more detailed projection later — that becomes a re-forecast,
not a new baseline. Original baseline is immutable.

**Curve-Weighted (Guided):**
User selects distribution shape from: Front-Loaded, Back-Loaded, Bell-Curve,
Custom-Percentage. System applies shape to total fee across months.
User can adjust individual months after shape is applied.

**Manual (Detailed):**
Full month-by-month entry per team member.
Pre-populated automatically if Method 2 Detailed was used for fee.
Otherwise blank: rows = team members, columns = months.

**staffing_projections table:**
```sql
projection_id    uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
project_id       uuid FK → projects NOT NULL
fee_id           uuid FK → fee_records NOT NULL
input_mode       enum('Straight-Line','Curve-Weighted','Manual')
status           enum('Draft','Baseline','Current','Superseded') default 'Draft'
created_at       timestamptz default now()
updated_at       timestamptz default now()
locked_at        timestamptz  -- set when status → Baseline
locked_by        uuid FK → auth.users
```

**projection_monthly_detail table:**
```sql
detail_id            uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
projection_id        uuid FK → staffing_projections NOT NULL
user_id              uuid FK → auth.users  -- nullable for role-based
role                 enum  -- role being projected
month                date NOT NULL  -- always first day of month
projected_hours      decimal(10,2)
projected_amount     decimal(12,2)  -- projected_hours × rate
actual_hours         decimal(10,2)  -- populated from approved timesheets
actual_amount        decimal(12,2)
reforecast_hours     decimal(10,2)  -- system calculated
reforecast_amount    decimal(12,2)  -- system calculated
```

**Re-forecast Logic — CRITICAL, automatic, runs on every timesheet approval:**

When a timesheet is approved, for each project in that timesheet:
1. Sum actual_hours and actual_amount for all completed months
2. Calculate total variance: baseline_total - actual_total_to_date
3. Remaining fee = contracted_fee - actual_amount_to_date
4. Distribute remaining fee across future months proportionally,
   weighted by the original baseline curve shape for those months
5. If under baseline: remaining months increase proportionally
6. If over baseline: remaining months compress proportionally
7. Update reforecast_hours and reforecast_amount for all future months
8. If any future month's reforecast_amount drops below
   (project.add_services_threshold_pct / 100) × that month's baseline_amount,
   trigger add services warning flag on project record

**Immutability:** Baseline projection (status = 'Baseline') rows are never updated.
Re-forecast updates only reforecast_hours and reforecast_amount columns.
projected_hours and projected_amount in Baseline records are permanent.

---

### 6.4 RATE CARDS

**Purpose:** Every billing rate in Cortina flows from here.
Historical accuracy is non-negotiable — timesheet entries always calculate
at the rate in effect on the date the work was performed.

**rate_cards table:**
```sql
rate_id             uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
user_id             uuid FK → auth.users  -- null for role-based rates
role                enum('Principal','Sr-PM','PM','Coordinator','Contracts',
                   'CM','Scheduling','Sustainability','BD','Admin','Custom')
rate_type           enum('Person-Specific','Role-Based')
billable_rate       decimal(10,2) NOT NULL  -- charged to clients
internal_cost_rate  decimal(10,2)  -- fully loaded PMG cost — Principal visibility only
effective_date      date NOT NULL
end_date            date  -- null = currently active
is_active           boolean default true
notes               text
created_by          uuid FK → auth.users
created_at          timestamptz default now()
```

**Rate lookup — always date-sensitive:**
```sql
WHERE (user_id = $user_id OR (role = $role AND rate_type = 'Role-Based'))
AND effective_date <= $work_date
AND (end_date IS NULL OR end_date >= $work_date)
ORDER BY rate_type = 'Person-Specific' DESC  -- person-specific takes priority
LIMIT 1
```

**rate_overrides table (project-specific):**
```sql
override_id       uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
project_id        uuid FK → projects NOT NULL
user_id           uuid FK → auth.users  -- null for role-based override
role              enum  -- null for person-specific override
override_rate     decimal(10,2) NOT NULL
effective_date    date NOT NULL
notes             text NOT NULL
created_by        uuid FK → auth.users
created_at        timestamptz default now()
```

Override takes precedence over standard rate card for that project.
Rate lookup checks overrides first, falls back to rate_cards.

**Rate card UI (simple list — superseded by Rate Builder below for role-based rates):**
- Active rates table: employee/role, current rate, effective date
- Rate history per employee: all historical records with dates
- Add rate form: always creates new record with effective_date — never edits existing
- Role-based rates section separate from person-specific
- internal_cost_rate column visible to Principal role only (RLS enforced)
- Annual review workflow: duplicate previous year's rates, update amounts, set new effective_date

---

#### RATE BUILDER (M1) — Redesigned Spec (Session 9)

The Rate Builder is a single-page module at `/rate-builder` (Management section, principal-only).
It replaces the simple rate card list with a full burden calculation engine. All data lives
on the existing `rate_cards` table with additional columns added via migration (see Section 16).

**TWO-SECTION LAYOUT:**

**Section 1 — Firm Assumptions** (full width, applies to all title stacks simultaneously):
- Bonus % — bonus as % of base salary
- Health & Welfare ($/yr) — medical, dental, vision, life, disability, HSA employer cost only. NOT firm insurance, NOT workers comp. Tooltip clarifies scope.
- Retirement Match % — 401k employer match
- Cell Phone ($/yr) — annual allowance per employee
- Holiday Days — paid holidays per year
- Payroll Taxes % — employer payroll taxes: FICA (7.65%) + FUTA/SUTA (~1-2%) + workers comp (~1-3%). Tooltip explains what to include. Replaces "Tax Rate %".
- Support Staff % — admin/support staff cost as % of cost/hr
- Profit Target % — target profit margin as % of cost/hr
- Overhead Line-Item Builder — replaces the separate Operating $/hr and Insurance $/hr fields (see below)

**Section 2 — Title Stacks** (tabbed, one at a time):
Five default stacks: Project Coordinator, Assistant Project Manager, Project Manager,
Senior Project Manager, Principal. Tabs are drag-to-reorder. Add/delete stacks. Sort order persisted.

**PER TITLE STACK — Cost Build-Up Card** (LOW and HIGH columns):

*Compensation:*
- Salary Low / Salary High — direct input
- Bonus — salary × bonus%
- Payroll Taxes — salary × payroll_taxes%
- Retirement Match — salary × retirement_match%
- Health & Welfare — flat annual amount from firm assumptions
- Cell Phone — flat annual amount from firm assumptions
- Holidays — (salary / 2080) × holiday_days × 8
- PTO Weeks — direct input per title
- PTO Cost — (salary / 2080) × pto_weeks × 40
- Utilization % — direct input per title
- Utilization Cost — total_loaded_compensation × (1 − utilization_pct / 100)
  WHERE total_loaded_compensation = salary + bonus + payroll_taxes + retirement_match + health_welfare + cell_phone + holidays + PTO cost
  **CRITICAL:** Utilization cost is calculated on fully-loaded compensation, NOT base salary only.
- Custom line items (jsonb) — label, amount, type ($ or % of salary), category (Compensation or Overhead)
- Total Annual Cost — sum of all above

*Overhead:*
- Overhead $/hr — calculated output from Overhead Line-Item Builder (not a manual input)
- Support Staff — cost_per_hour × support_staff%
- Profit — cost_per_hour × profit_target%
- Total Overhead/Hr — sum of all above

*Rate Calculation:*
- Total Annual Cost — from compensation
- Billable Hours — always 2,080 (fixed)
- Cost Per Hour — total_annual_cost / 2,080
- + Total Overhead/Hr
- Required Rate — cost_per_hour + total_overhead_per_hour
- Required Rate Avg — average of low and high
- Published Rate — editable field, color coded: green if ≥ required rate avg, red if below

**OVERHEAD LINE-ITEM BUILDER:**
A modal that opens when the user clicks the Overhead field. Replaces both Operating $/hr and
Insurance $/hr fields. Full line-item builder, not a simple frequency calculator.

Pre-populated categories:
- Facilities & Operations: office rent/lease, utilities, office supplies, postage, parking
- Insurance: GL insurance, professional liability/E&O, workers comp (firm-level policy, separate from payroll tax), cyber liability, D&O
- Technology & Software: software licenses (per seat × headcount), cloud storage, IT support, phone system
- People & Administrative: professional development, conferences/memberships, recruitment/onboarding, background checks
- Other: accounting/bookkeeping, legal fees, bank fees, marketing overhead, custom items

Each line item has: label (editable), annual amount ($), notes (optional), delete button, active/inactive toggle.

Bottom of modal shows:
- Total Annual Overhead — sum of all active line items
- Projected Billable Hours — auto-calculated from all title stacks (sum of each stack × utilization% × 2,080)
- Calculated Overhead $/hr — Total ÷ Projected Billable Hours
- This $/hr writes back to the overhead field automatically on modal close
- If any title stack utilization % changes after overhead was last calculated, show a stale indicator on the overhead field

Storage: `overhead_line_items` jsonb on `firm_settings` table.

**CALCULATION HELPER POPOVERS** (existing pattern — see Section 19 L15):
Available on Health & Welfare and Cell Phone. User enters amount + frequency (per month/week/pay
period/year/hour), system calculates annual total. Inputs persist via `calc_amount` and `calc_freq` fields.

**SAVE BEHAVIOR:**
- Auto-save on blur for all individual fields
- Firm assumption changes update ALL Role-Based rate_cards records simultaneously (see Section 19 L14)
- Calculated outputs stored: `cost_per_hour_low`, `cost_per_hour_high`, `required_rate_low`, `required_rate_high`, `required_rate_avg`

---

**users table extension (extends Supabase auth.users):**
```sql
-- public.users (mirrors/extends auth.users)
user_id                uuid PK references auth.users
first_name             text
last_name              text
role                   enum('Principal','Sr-PM','PM','Coordinator',
                      'Contracts','BD','Admin','Custom')
utilization_target_pct decimal(5,2)  -- individual target, e.g. 85.00
is_active              boolean default true
hire_date              date
department             text
created_at             timestamptz default now()
updated_at             timestamptz default now()
```

---

### 6.5 TIMESHEETS

**Purpose:** Weekly time entry for all employees. Billable/non-billable is
structurally determined by the code type — never by employee input.
Feeds utilization calculations, invoice generation, and staffing re-forecast.

**billing_codes table:**
```sql
code_id                  uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
code                     text UNIQUE NOT NULL  -- "PMG-2026-001", "BD", "TRAIN"
description              text NOT NULL
code_type                enum('Project','Non-Billable')
is_billable              boolean NOT NULL  -- inherited from code_type, not user-set
requires_description     boolean default false  -- triggers popup on cell entry
non_billable_category    enum('Business-Development','Training','Administration',
                        'Education','PTO','Holiday','Other')  -- null for Project codes
project_id               uuid FK → projects  -- null for Non-Billable codes
is_active                boolean default true
created_at               timestamptz default now()
```

**Pre-loaded non-billable codes (from seed script):**
```
BD      | Business Development  | Non-Billable | requires_description: false
TRAIN   | Training & Education  | Non-Billable | requires_description: false
ADMIN   | Administration        | Non-Billable | requires_description: false
PTO     | Paid Time Off         | Non-Billable | requires_description: false
HOLIDAY | Holiday               | Non-Billable | requires_description: false
OOO     | Out of Office         | Non-Billable | requires_description: false
```

Project codes created automatically when project status → Active.
Code value = project.project_number.

**timesheets table:**
```sql
timesheet_id     uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
user_id          uuid FK → auth.users NOT NULL
week_start_date  date NOT NULL  -- always Sunday
week_end_date    date NOT NULL  -- always Saturday
billing_month    date NOT NULL  -- first day of billing month this week belongs to
status           enum('Draft','Submitted','Approved','Returned','Locked') default 'Draft'
submitted_at     timestamptz
submitted_by     uuid FK → auth.users
approved_at      timestamptz
approved_by      uuid FK → auth.users
returned_at      timestamptz
returned_by      uuid FK → auth.users
return_notes     text
created_at       timestamptz default now()
updated_at       timestamptz default now()
UNIQUE(user_id, week_start_date)
```

**timesheet_entries table:**
```sql
entry_id          uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
timesheet_id      uuid FK → timesheets NOT NULL
code_id           uuid FK → billing_codes NOT NULL
entry_date        date NOT NULL
hours             decimal(5,2) NOT NULL
description       text  -- required when billing_code.requires_description = true
service_category  enum('A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I')  -- optional, for benchmarking
is_billable       boolean NOT NULL  -- copied from billing_code.is_billable at entry time
rate_applied      decimal(10,2)  -- rate card rate on entry_date — set on approval
amount            decimal(12,2)  -- hours × rate_applied — set on approval
created_at        timestamptz default now()
updated_at        timestamptz default now()
```

**Timesheet UI — Full Specification:**

**Page opening:**
- Opens to current week automatically
- Week selector dropdown at top of page
- Each week in dropdown shows status badge:
  Approved (green) / Submitted-Pending (amber) / Draft (gray) / Missing (red)
- Missing = prior week with no timesheet record exists
- Future weeks accessible but blank

**New week state:**
Completely blank — no codes, no hours, no pre-population. Clean slate.

**Action buttons (top of page, left of utilization dashboard):**

COPY (dropdown):
- "Copy Previous" — imports code list from immediately preceding submitted week
- "Select Week" — opens date picker / week list; user selects any prior week
- Copy behavior: code list only — no hours, no descriptions transferred
- Code list is fully editable immediately after copy — not locked
- If any codes already exist: confirm before overwriting

SAVE:
- Saves current state as Draft
- No notification sent, no workflow triggered
- Auto-save also runs every 60 seconds in background

SUBMIT:
- Validates: at least one entry with hours > 0
- Sets status = 'Submitted', submitted_at = now()
- Locks timesheet — employee cannot edit
- Sends notification to assigned approver
- Cannot be undone by employee — only Principal can unlock

**Grid layout:**

Header row: Code | Description | [Sun date] | [Mon date] | [Tue date] |
            [Wed date] | [Thu date] | [Fri date] | [Sat date] | Week Total | [Delete]

Data rows:
- Code cell: smart search input — type code number OR description text
  — auto-completes both directions, shows matching options in dropdown
  — on selection: populates code and description, determines is_billable from code
- Description cell: read-only, auto-populated from code
- Day cells (Sun-Sat): numeric input for hours (decimal, e.g. 2.5)
  — greyed out and disabled for dates outside current billing_month
  — on click: if code.requires_description = true AND hours entered,
    opens description popup (text area, save button)
  — on click: if code is Project type, shows optional service_category dropdown
    (A through I, optional, one click, saves to entry)
- Week Total cell: auto-calculated sum, read-only
- Delete button: icon button far right, always visible on rows with codes
  — if row has hours: "This row has hours logged. Delete anyway?" confirmation
  — blank rows: no delete button shown

**Blank bottom row:**
- Always one blank row at bottom of the grid
- Activates when user starts typing in Code cell
- When a code is entered in current blank row, new blank row appears below
- No "Add Row" button — the blank row IS the add mechanism

**Footer row (below all code rows, per day column):**
- Total hours for the day (all codes)
- Billable hours for the day (is_billable = true codes only)
- Daily utilization % = billable_hours ÷ (utilization_target_pct/100 × 8)
  — color coded: ≥target green, 60-99% amber, <60% red

**Footer summary (bottom right):**
- Total hours for week
- Total billable hours for week
- Weekly utilization % = total_billable ÷ (utilization_target_pct/100 × 40)
- Color coded same as daily

**Description popup (modal):**
- Triggered: cell click when code.requires_description = true and hours > 0
- Simple modal: project name + date as header, textarea for description, Save button
- Saved to entry.description
- Flows to invoice if project.invoice_detail_level = 'By-Employee-with-Descriptions'

**Service category dropdown:**
- Appears inline below hours cell on click for Project codes only
- Nine options labeled: A - Predevelopment, B - Design Consultant Selection, etc.
- Optional — never required, never blocks submit
- Closes automatically on selection
- Stored in entry.service_category

**Utilization dashboard panel (persistent, right side or top of page):**
Shows employee's own data only. Real-time — updates as hours are entered.

Metrics displayed:
- This week: X hrs billable / Y hrs target / Z% utilization / on-track indicator
- Last week: X% actual
- Last month: X% actual
- Last quarter: X% actual
- YTD: X% actual vs [target]% target
- Projected year-end: at current pace, will hit X% — [on track / X hrs/week needed]

Color coding: ≥target green, 60-99% amber, <60% red

**Month boundary enforcement:**
- billing_month on timesheet record = month that contains the majority of the week
  OR the month the work falls in for split weeks
- Day cells outside billing_month: background #E5E7EB, disabled, cannot receive input
- Week selector correctly shows partial weeks at month boundaries
- A week spanning Jan 31 - Feb 6 creates entries in two billing months if needed
  (one timesheet per billing_month per week_start_date per user)

**Notifications:**
- Friday 4pm: reminder if current week timesheet not Submitted (configurable)
- Monday 9am: alert if prior week still not Submitted (configurable)
- Day 5+ overdue: escalation notification to assigned manager / Principal
- All notifications: in-app notification + email

**Approval workflow:**
1. Employee submits → status = 'Submitted'
2. Approver notified (assigned manager or Principal)
3. Approver reviews in leadership dashboard
4. Approve → status = 'Approved', rate_applied and amount populated on all entries,
   triggers re-forecast update on all referenced projects
5. Return → status = 'Returned', return_notes required,
   employee notified, timesheet unlocks for editing
6. After correction: employee resubmits → back to step 2

**Unlock (Principal only):**
Approved timesheets can be unlocked by Principal for correction.
Unlock requires notes explaining reason. Audit log entry created.
After correction and resubmission, re-approval required.

**Leadership timesheet status dashboard (separate view):**
- All active employees listed
- Current week status per employee with days-since indicator
- Prior weeks: any missing or pending flagged
- Bulk actions: send reminder, escalate
- Real-time, no manual refresh

### 6.6 INVOICING & AR

**Purpose:** Generate, review, approve, deliver, and track invoices.
Close the loop between time worked and money collected.

log_id           uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
invoice_id       uuid FK → invoices NOT NULL
contact_date     date NOT NULL
contact_method   enum('Phone','Email','In-Person','Letter')
contacted_by     uuid FK → auth.users
spoke_with       text  -- name of client contact
notes            text NOT NULL
promised_date    date  -- client committed to pay by this date
is_disputed      boolean default false
created_at       timestamptz default now()
```

**Invoice Generation Process:**
1. Principal or Admin triggers generation at month end
2. System checks for each active project:
   - Are all timesheet_entries for this project × billing_month Approved?
   - If no: list missing/pending timesheets, require Principal decision:
     a) Wait for outstanding timesheets, or
     b) Proceed with approved hours only (note on invoice)
3. Aggregate approved entries per project.invoice_detail_level:
   - Summary: one line, total hours, total amount
   - By-Employee: one line per user_id, hours and amount
   - By-Employee-with-Descriptions: same + array of entry.description values
4. Apply any fee_discounts with discount_type applicable to billing
5. Calculate subtotal, discount_amount, total_due
6. Create invoice record, status = 'Draft'
7. Generate PDF (store in Supabase Storage, save URL to pdf_url)
8. Update status = 'Stage1-Review', notify Stage 1 reviewer

**PDF Structure:**

HEADER:
- PMG logo (from /public/assets/pmg-logo.png)
- PMG name, address, phone, email
- "INVOICE" title
- Invoice #, Invoice Date, Billing Period
- Bill To: client company name + billing address
- Project: project_name (project_number)
- Contract Reference: contract_type + executed_date
- PO Number (if applicable)

BODY:
Line items per invoice_detail_level setting
Subtotal line
Discount lines (one per discount, labeled by type)
TOTAL DUE line (bold)

FEE TRACKING SUMMARY BOX:
| Original Contracted Fee | $XXX,XXX |
| Previously Billed       | $XXX,XXX |
| This Invoice            | $XXX,XXX |
| Total Billed to Date    | $XXX,XXX |
| Remaining Fee Balance   | $XXX,XXX |
| % of Fee Consumed       | XX%      |

OUTSTANDING BALANCE TABLE (default: show all open invoices for this project):
| Invoice # | Date | Amount | Days Outstanding |
(configurable per project: Show All / Overdue Only / Hide)
Total Outstanding: $XXX,XXX

FOOTER:
Payment Terms: Net XX
Payment Instructions: [ACH info / Check payable to / Wire instructions]
[Late payment language from firm_settings]
Thank you for your business.

**Two-Stage Approval Workflow:**

Stage 1 — Project Team Review (target: 48 hours):
- Reviewer: project_manager on the project
- Notification: email + in-app on invoice creation
- Actions:
  - Approve → status = 'Stage2-Review', notify Principal
  - Return → status = 'Draft', return_notes required, notify creator
  - Flag → Approve but add note for Principal attention
- Reviewer sees outstanding balance summary during review
- Escalation notification if not actioned within 48 hours

Stage 2 — Principal Final Approval (target: 24 hours):
- Reviewer: Principal / designated billing approver
- Actions:
  - Approve & Send → generates/confirms PDF, sends email, status = 'Sent'
  - Approve & Hold → status = 'Approved-Hold' (awaiting timing/call)
  - Return to Stage 1 → status = 'Stage1-Review', notes required
  - Edit then Approve → minor edits permitted before approval, then send
- Escalation notification if not actioned within 24 hours

**Automated Email Delivery (triggered by Approve & Send):**
- To: client contacts where is_invoice_recipient = true
- CC: PMG team members configured at project level
- Subject: "Invoice #[number] — [Project Name] — [Billing Period]"
- Body: firm-level template with merge fields (project, amount, due date, payment instructions)
- Attachment: invoice PDF
- Sent from PMG email address via configured SMTP (Resend or equivalent)
- Delivery logged: sent_at, recipients, delivery status

**Payment Recording:**
- Select open invoice
- Enter: amount, payment_date, payment_method, reference, notes
- System calculates: amount_paid + new payment amount
- If amount_paid + payment = total_due: status = 'Paid', balance_due = 0
- If amount_paid + payment < total_due: status = 'Partially-Paid', balance_due updates
- Payment record created in payments table
- Paid invoices: immutable (no further edits to invoice record)

**AR Dashboard:**
Real-time table of all open invoices across all projects.

Columns: Invoice # | Project | Client | Invoice Date | Due Date |
         Amount | Paid | Balance | Days Outstanding | Status

Aging summary at top: Current | 1-30 | 31-60 | 61-90 | 90+ (dollar totals per bucket)
Sortable by any column. Filterable by project, client, status, aging bucket.
Export to CSV button.

**Late Payment Automation:**
- X days before due (configurable, default 5): reminder notification to AR manager
- On due date if unpaid: flag invoice, notification to Principal
- 30 days overdue: escalation notification
- 60 days overdue: escalation notification
- 90 days overdue: escalation notification + recommend collection log entry

**Cash Position View (on AR dashboard):**
- Month-to-date: payments received
- Open invoices: sum by expected payment date
- 90-day forward: projected invoice generation from staffing re-forecasts
- Simple cash flow chart: expected in by month for next 3 months

**Standalone — no accounting integration in v1:**
CSV export covers accountant handoff.
QuickBooks / accounting software integration is a planned v2 feature.
Design data model to support future integration (clean invoice/payment records,
clear status tracking, no workarounds that would complicate export later).

## 7. MODULE SPECS — PHASE 2

---

### 7.1 FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS (M5)

**Purpose:** Firm-level dashboard aggregating all active project projections.
Primarily a consumption and analysis layer on Phase 1 data.

**Firm-Level Revenue Dashboard:**
- Total projected billing by month across all active projects
- Total actual billing by month from approved invoices
- Variance: projected vs actual, by month and cumulative
- Forward view: next 3, 6, 12 months projected revenue
- Add services warnings across all projects in one consolidated view
- Lump sum health: all fixed-fee projects, cumulative delta, trending favorable or at risk
- Drillable to individual project detail

**Cross-Validation Alert:**
When financial projection and staffing projection diverge beyond configurable threshold — flag for PM review. Forces conscious reconciliation.

**Phase 1 additions required before Phase 2 build:**
- Add service workflow (add_services table — already in schema)
- Lump sum tracking: lump_sum_billed, hours_value, lump_sum_delta, cumulative_lump_sum_delta on projection_monthly_detail

---

### 7.2 STAFFING & UTILIZATION (M4)

**Purpose:** Employee-level utilization planning and tracking. First place employee-specific projections are built.

**staffing_allocations table (new in Phase 2):**
```sql
allocation_id       uuid PK default gen_random_uuid()
project_id          uuid FK → projects NOT NULL
user_id             uuid FK → auth.users NOT NULL
month               date NOT NULL
projected_hours     decimal(10,2)
status              enum('Draft','Pending-Approval','Approved') default 'Draft'
submitted_by        uuid FK → auth.users
submitted_at        timestamptz
approved_by         uuid FK → auth.users
approved_at         timestamptz
return_notes        text
created_at          timestamptz default now()
updated_at          timestamptz default now()
UNIQUE(project_id, user_id, month)
```

**Firm Grid (main view):**
- Rows = employees, Columns = rolling months, Cells = total utilization %
- Future months: Green ≥ target, Red < target, Gray = no projection
- Past months: Blue ≥ projection, Amber < projection
- Past months pending close: muted color with pending indicator dot
- Current month: progress indicator
- Far right: annual utilization % total

**Cell colors:**
- Future, at/above target: #10B981 (green)
- Future, below target: #EF4444 (red)
- Future, no projection: #E5E7EB (gray)
- Past, actual ≥ projected: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Past, actual < projected: #F59E0B (amber)
- Past pending close: muted with indicator dot

**Employee Detail View (click any row):**
- Rows = projects, Columns = months, Cells = projected hours
- Same color logic, past month hover shows "Projected: X | Actual: Y | Variance: Z"
- Data entry here — click cell, enter hours
- Blank bottom row to add new project allocation

**Approval Workflow:**
- Employee edits own projection → Draft, manager notified
- Manager approves → finalized, firm grid updates
- Manager edits direct report → immediately finalized, employee notified
- Manager login shows pending approval queue

**Access:**
- Principal: full firm grid, edit anyone
- Managers: full firm grid visible (to identify capacity for staffing), edit direct reports only
- Employees: own detail view only

**FTE Planning:**
Stack all project staffing projections to show total demand vs capacity.
Over/under capacity signal by month. FTE gap calculation.

---

### 7.3 EXPENSE REPORTS (E3)

**Purpose:** Employee expense submission, approval, reimbursement, billable expense flow to invoicing.

**Workflow:** Ad hoc submission (not weekly cycle) → Stage 1 manager review → Stage 2 Principal approval → reimbursement tracking / billable expenses to invoicing

**expense_reports table:** report_id, user_id, report_name, report_period_start/end, status, total_amount, reimbursable_amount, approval chain timestamps

**expense_line_items table:** line_item_id, report_id, expense_date, description, vendor, amount, code_id, is_billable (from code), payment_method (Company-Card/Personal-Card), attachment_url (REQUIRED), attachment_type (Receipt/Mileage-Log), mileage_miles, requires_attendees, attendees (jsonb)

**HARD RULES:**
1. Every line item requires an attachment before submission — hard block, not a warning
2. Meal/entertainment codes require attendee list — hard block
   - Minimum one attendee beyond submitter
   - External attendees require company name
   - Attendee list flows to invoice if billable

**Non-billable overhead codes:**
TRAVEL-AIR, TRAVEL-HOTEL, TRAVEL-CAR, MEALS-CLIENT (requires_attendees), MEALS-TEAM (requires_attendees), OFFICE, TRAINING, OTHER

**Post-approval:**
- Personal card items → reimbursement records, outstanding reimbursements dashboard
- Billable items → queue for next project invoice, shown as separate line items
- Company card → tracked for cost accounting, no reimbursement

---

### 7.4 UNIFIED APPROVAL QUEUE (M8)

A first-class feature surfaced in Phase 1 (timesheets, invoices) and expanded in Phase 2.

**Queue items:**
- Timesheets pending approval
- Expense reports pending (Stage 1 from direct reports, Stage 2 for Principal)
- Staffing allocation changes pending
- Invoice Stage 1 reviews (project managers)
- Invoice Stage 2 reviews (Principal)
- Add service requests (Principal)
- PTO requests (managers)

**Display:** Badge on top bar (count) + dedicated queue view. Sorted by days pending — oldest first. One-click approve or return with notes.

---

## 8. PHASE 3 — FRONT END (Future Spec)

**Full CRM & Pipeline**
Pursuit tracking: leads, proposals, probability, projected fee, expected start.
Win rate, conversion rate, pipeline dashboard.
Connects to Client Records from Phase 1 — no new client data entry.

**Rate Development Tool**
Dynamic rate modeling: fully_loaded_cost ÷ target_billable_hours × (1 + margin).
Inputs: salary, benefits, taxes, overhead allocation, utilization target, margin target.
Scenario modeling. Annual rate setting with prior year actuals pre-populated.
Real-time alert when actual margin diverges from target margin.
Utilization assumption connects to actual utilization from Phase 2.

---

## 9. PHASE 4 — INFRASTRUCTURE (Future Spec)

**User Roles & Permissions — Full UI Implementation**
Role-based access fully surfaced in UI (database already enforces it from Phase 1).
User management interface for Principals.
Invite flow, role assignment, deactivation.

**Reporting & Dashboard**
Firm-level executive dashboard.
Project health across all active projects.
Financial performance: revenue, margin, utilization by person and project.
AR aging summary. Pipeline to revenue conversion. Exportable reports.

---

## 10. FUTURE PRODUCT — ARCHIVIO (Concept Only)

Third product in the Vetta suite. Not in scope for this build.

**Concept:** Qualifications and experience database.
Search employees by project type, client, scope, keywords.
Generate pursuit-specific and project-specific resumes per employee.
Pull project data from Vetta and Cortina automatically — no re-entry.
Serves BD and marketing functions.

Name "Archivio" is a placeholder — naming not yet finalized.
Lowest priority build in the entire portfolio.

## 12. CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

**Schema supports all phases from day one.**
Do not design Phase 1 tables in isolation. Every table must be compatible with
Phase 2-4 additions. Foreign keys, enums, and field structures must anticipate
future modules even if the UI does not surface them yet.

**Responsive-first — no exceptions.**
Every component built with mobile/tablet breakpoints from first commit.
iPad is a primary device for timesheet entry — treat as equal to desktop.
Do not build desktop components and retrofit responsiveness later.
This is the lesson from Vetta's responsive debt. Do not repeat it.

**Immutability rules — enforce at database level:**
- Executed fee records: RLS policy prevents updates after executed_at is set
- Baseline projections: projected_hours and projected_amount columns never updated
- Approved timesheet entries: RLS prevents updates, Principal unlock required
- Paid invoices: no edits to invoice record after status = 'Paid'
- Rate history: never delete rate_cards records, only add new with effective_date

**Re-forecast is automatic and background.**
Runs on every timesheet approval. Users do not trigger it.
Must be efficient — avoid N+1 queries, use single SQL update per project per approval.

**Billable determination is structural — not user input.**
is_billable on timesheet_entries is ALWAYS copied from billing_code.is_billable.
Employee has no ability to override. Enforce in database trigger, not just UI.

**Rate lookup is always date-sensitive.**
Never apply a current rate to a historical entry.
Always use the rate in effect on the entry_date.
Rate lookup function must be used consistently — no shortcuts.

**One source of truth — no duplication.**
Client data: clients table only.
Project data: projects table only.
User data: users table only.
Denormalize ONLY for PDF stability (user_name and role on invoice_line_items).
All other references are foreign keys.

**React Context from day one.**
No prop drilling anywhere in the codebase.
Create contexts for: AuthContext, ProjectContext, TimesheetContext, NotificationContext.
Add contexts as needed — never pass data more than one level as props.

**Supabase RLS on every sensitive table.**
Principal-only: internal_cost_rate, margin calculations, all users' financial data.
Employee-scoped: timesheets (own only), utilization data (own only).
Project-scoped: project financial data visible to assigned team + Principal.
Test RLS policies before moving to next module.

is_custom = false for all seeded items.

---

## 14. SESSION 1 — STARTING INSTRUCTIONS

**Objective:** Complete Supabase schema setup and project scaffold.
No UI components in Session 1. Schema correctness is the only deliverable.

**Step 1 — Project Setup:**
```
1. Create GitHub repository: alta-via
2. Initialize: git init, add CLAUDE.md to root
3. Create Vite + React app: npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
4. Install dependencies:
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js react-router-dom
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
5. Configure Tailwind (tailwind.config.js content paths)
6. Create .env file:
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
7. Add to .gitignore: .env, node_modules, dist
8. Create src/lib/supabase.js with client initialization
9. Confirm: npm run dev — dev server runs on localhost:5173
10. First git commit: "Initial project scaffold"
```

**Step 2 — Supabase Project:**
```
1. Create new Supabase project: alta-via (or alta-via-pmg)
2. Copy Project URL and anon key to .env
3. Update this CLAUDE.md with:
   - Supabase Project ID
   - Supabase Project URL
   - GitHub repo URL
```

**Step 3 — Database Schema (SQL Migrations):**
Write and execute migrations for all tables in this exact order
(respects foreign key dependencies):

```sql
-- 1. firm_settings
-- 2. public.users (extends auth.users)
-- 3. clients
-- 4. client_contacts
-- 5. projects
-- 6. project_team_assignments
-- 7. billing_codes
-- 8. scope_library
-- 9. rate_cards
-- 10. rate_overrides
-- 11. fee_records
-- 12. fee_line_items
-- 13. fee_discounts
-- 14. staffing_projections
-- 15. projection_monthly_detail
-- 16. timesheets
-- 17. timesheet_entries
-- 18. invoices
-- 19. invoice_line_items
-- 20. payments
-- 21. invoice_collection_log
```

Use exact field names, types, and constraints from Section 6 of this document.
Create all enums before tables that reference them.
Add updated_at trigger function to all tables with updated_at column.

**Step 4 — RLS Policies:**
Enable RLS on all tables.
Write policies for Principal, Sr-PM/PM, Coordinator, Admin roles.
Test: create test users for each role, verify access boundaries.

**Step 5 — Seed Data:**
Write and run seed script for:
- 1 firm_settings record (PMG defaults)
- 6 non-billable billing codes (BD, TRAIN, ADMIN, PTO, HOLIDAY, OOO)
- 123 scope_library items from Attachment A Excel file

**Step 6 — Verification:**
- Open Supabase table editor
- Confirm all 21 tables exist with correct columns
- Confirm all foreign key relationships
- Confirm enum types
- Confirm RLS is enabled on all tables
- Confirm seed data is present
- Take screenshot of table list for build log

**Do NOT build any UI components in Session 1.**
**Confirm schema in Supabase before ending session.**
**Update BUILD LOG below before closing.**

---

## 15. WORKSHOP → BUILD HANDOFF PROTOCOL

This chat (Cortina Workshop) handles all strategy and spec decisions.
Claude Code (Cortina Build) handles all implementation.

**When to come back to Workshop:**
- Something isn't working as specced — discuss before hacking a workaround
- A new requirement emerges — spec it here first
- An architectural decision needs to be made — always decide here
- A module needs fuller spec before build begins

**Workshop outputs Build Directives:**
Each Claude Code session receives a scoped Build Directive:
- What to build (specific, one module or component at a time)
- Which files to touch
- Relevant spec section from CLAUDE.md
- Constraints and conventions
- How to verify it worked

**Paste this at the start of every Claude Code session:**
"Read CLAUDE.md fully before writing any code.
We are on Session [N]. Today's objective is [specific task].
Follow all conventions in CLAUDE.md. Confirm your understanding
of the task before beginning."

---

## 16. MIGRATIONS COMPLETED

All migrations have been run in Supabase. Do not re-run.

**001_schema.sql** — Complete database schema: 21 tables, enums, triggers, indexes
**002_rls.sql** — Row Level Security policies for all tables
**003_seed.sql** — firm_settings, 6 non-billable billing codes, 123 scope_library items (placeholder)
**004_grants.sql** — Explicit GRANT statements (required for Supabase projects after May 30, 2026)
**005_scope_library_real_data.sql** — 123 real Attachment A scope items loaded (replaced placeholders)

**Additional schema changes applied directly:**
- scope_unit_enum extended: added per-week, per-month, total, each, lump-sum
- fee_records: added preconstruction_duration, preconstruction_duration_unit, construction_duration, construction_duration_unit
- fee_line_items: added qty_override boolean default false
- staffing_projections: added projection_type, add_service_id, superseded_at, superseded_by, notes

- projects: added reporting_month date (from Vetta lessons learned)
- users: added manager_id uuid FK → users
- add_services table created
- invoice_line_items: added line_type (Timesheet/Expense)

**Next migration needed before Phase 2 build:**
- staffing_allocations table (see Phase 2 spec Section 7.2)
- Rate Builder columns on rate_cards + firm_settings (see Section 6.4 Rate Builder spec) — NOT YET RUN:

```sql
-- Rate Builder columns on rate_cards

## 17. BUILD LOG

### Session 1 — 2026-05-20
**Objective:** Supabase schema + project scaffold
**What was built:** Complete database schema (21 tables, RLS, seed data), src/lib/supabase.js, directory structure
**Supabase Project ID:** ozkrhngpccwlzjsxezyu
**GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/mspalumbo/cortina

### Session 2 — Client Records module
**What was built:** Client list page, client detail page, inline contact management, wired to Supabase

### Session 3 — Projects module
**What was built:** Project list, project detail, team assignments, project status workflow

### Session 4 — Rate Cards module
**What was built:** Rate card list, add/edit rates, effective date history, role-based rates

### Session 5a — Fee Development foundation
**What was built:** Fee list (project-grouped accordion), fee detail, fee status workflow, fee create modal

### Session 5b — Fee Line Items (Scope-Based)
**What was built:**
- Scope-based line item builder (two-panel layout: library browser + grid)
- Duration inputs (Preconstruction + Construction) in Fee Summary card
- Smart unit selector: Per Week, Per Month, Each, Lump Sum
- Qty auto-calculate from duration with override flag (qty_override)
- Category grouping with subtotals in dark green header rows
- Exhibit A export (new browser tab, professional print document)
- Sidebar rebuilt: collapsible CRM/Projects/Employee/Management sections
- Scope library: 123 real Attachment A items loaded

### Session 5c — Next
**Objective:** Discounts module in Fee Development

### Session 9 — Rate Builder spec redesign (spec only, no code)
**Objective:** Redesign the Rate Builder (M1) spec in CLAUDE.md ahead of build.
**What changed (Section 6.4 + Section 16 migration list):**
- Utilization calculation corrected — utilization cost is now calculated on fully-loaded
  compensation (salary + bonus + payroll taxes + retirement match + health & welfare +
  cell phone + holidays + PTO cost), not on base salary only
- Insurance/benefits/overhead structure clarified and simplified: Health & Welfare is
  explicitly scoped to medical/dental/vision/life/disability/HSA employer cost only —
  firm insurance and workers comp are excluded and now live in the overhead line-item
  builder instead; Payroll Taxes % explicitly covers FICA + FUTA/SUTA + workers comp
  (replaces the old flat "Tax Rate %")
- Overhead Line-Item Builder added, replacing the flat Operating $/hr and Insurance $/hr
  fields — a modal with pre-populated categories (Facilities & Operations, Insurance,
  Technology & Software, People & Administrative, Other) that rolls up to a calculated
  Overhead $/hr, stored as `overhead_line_items` jsonb on `firm_settings`
- Added the pending migration (not yet run) for the new rate_cards columns and the
  firm_settings.overhead_line_items column — see Section 16
- No component files were touched this session — spec and migration doc only

### Session 9b — Rate Builder (M1) build
**Objective:** Build the redesigned Rate Builder module at /rate-builder per the Session 9 spec.
**What was built:**
- `src/utils/rateBuilder.js` — shared constants/helpers (`ANNUAL_HOURS`, `fmt`, `fmtRate`,
  `parseNum`, `parseCurrency`, `projectedBillableHours`) used by both Rate Builder components
- `src/components/rates/RateBuilder.jsx` — main module: Firm Assumptions card (bonus %,
  health & welfare, retirement match, cell phone, holiday days, payroll taxes %, support
  staff %, profit target %, plus the calculated Overhead $/hr field) and tabbed Title
  Stacks with the full two-column (Low/High) cost build-up card, calc-helper popovers on
  Health & Welfare and Cell Phone, and a Custom Items section (Compensation or Overhead,
  $ or % of salary)
- `src/components/rates/OverheadBuilder.jsx` — modal line-item builder, pre-populated
  categories/items, computes Total Annual Overhead ÷ Projected Billable Hours
- `src/pages/RateBuilderPage.jsx` — reduced to a thin `PageWrapper` + `RateBuilder` wrapper
- App.jsx route (`/rate-builder`) and Sidebar "Rate Builder" nav item were already wired
  correctly from a prior session — no changes needed

**Key decisions:**
- Utilization cost is calculated on fully-loaded compensation (salary + bonus + payroll
  taxes + retirement match + health & welfare + cell phone + holidays + PTO cost), matching
  the corrected spec — not on base salary alone
- Overhead $/hr has no dedicated rate_cards/firm_settings column in the approved migration,
  so the calculated rate is cached inside the `overhead_line_items` jsonb blob itself
  (`{ items, calculated_rate, calculated_hours, calculated_total }`) rather than requiring
  a further migration. A stale indicator compares `calculated_hours` against the live
  sum of `target_utilization_pct/100 × 2080` across all stacks and flags when they diverge
- Overhead Line-Item Builder pre-populates its default categories/items only in local
  state on open (per spec) — nothing is written to `firm_settings` until Close & Save
- This entirely replaces the Session 6a Rate Builder implementation (old field names:
  `benefits_annual`, `overhead_operating`, `overhead_insurance`, `overhead_taxes_pct`,
  etc. — all dropped in the Session 9 migration). Drag-to-reorder title-stack tabs from
  Session 6a was intentionally NOT carried forward this session — tabs are static order
  for now, reorder to be re-added in a future session
- `src/pages/RateCardsPage.jsx` + `src/components/rates/RateCardList.jsx`/`RateCardForm.jsx`
  (the old simple rate list at `/rates`) were left untouched, as directed
- `src/components/rates/RateBuilderDetail.jsx` / `RateBuilderList.jsx` remain as unused
  stub files from the Session 6a refactor — not imported anywhere, left in place

### Session 7 — Timecards (E1)
**What was built:**
- TimesheetsPage.jsx — week selector (Sun-Sat), prev/next navigation, Copy/Save/Submit buttons, Grid/List toggle, defaults to current week on load
- TimesheetGrid.jsx — weekly grid with CODE/DESCRIPTION/Sun-Sat/TOTAL/DELETE columns, smart code search dropdown, blank bottom row pattern, inline save on blur, daily and weekly footer totals, weekend columns visually de-emphasized, approval workflow (Submit/Approve/Return)
- TimesheetList.jsx — recent weeks list with status badges
- UtilizationPanel.jsx — This Week/Last Week/This Month/YTD metrics, 85% default target, placeholder note for E4 projection feed

**Key decisions:**
- Weeks run Sunday→Saturday (matches DB schema)
- Split weeks (spanning two months): the DB's UNIQUE(user_id, week_start_date) plus week-span/DOW CHECK constraints make a true two-record split impossible without a migration. Built as a single timesheet record instead — billing_month = whichever month contains the majority of the 7 days; days outside billing_month are greyed and disabled in the grid. getWeekRecords() still returns an array for forward compatibility with a future migration, but always has one element today.
- TEST_USER_ID = '1683e702-bbee-426f-92fd-cad64b8cd731' (matt@vettapm.com) hardcoded — replace with auth.uid() when auth is built
- is_billable always copied from billing_code via the enforce_is_billable DB trigger — never user-editable
- rate_applied and amount are left null on entry and remain null through Approve — populating them requires the rate-lookup and re-forecast machinery, which isn't built yet. Approve currently only locks status.
- DESCRIPTION is one field per code-row per week in the UI, even though timesheet_entries.description is a per-day column — the row's text is write-through synced across every day-entry for that code/week
- OOO billing code deactivated (redundant with PTO)
- Utilization projection comparison (vs E4) deferred until E4 is built

## 18. LESSONS LEARNED FROM VETTA BUILD

Apply these proactively — do not wait to rediscover them.

### L1 — Hash-Based URL Routing (build from day one)
Implement hash-based URL routing from Session 2 forward.
Write navigation state to window.location.hash on every nav change.
On mount, useEffect reads hash and restores state.
toSlug(): name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-').replace(/^-|-$/g, '')
writeHash() must be called after every setActiveNav() call.
Mount restore effect must only gate on sessionLoaded — NOT projectLoaded (deadlock risk).

### L2 — recharts v2.12.7 Fatal Bar Chart Bug
recharts crashes with "minPointSize is not a function" on any Bar component.
Build ALL bar charts as pure SVG. This is not a hack — it gives full control.

### L3 — Shared Utility Functions
When a calculation is needed in more than one module, extract immediately to src/utils/.
Never duplicate calculation logic. Examples: src/utils/utilization.js, src/utils/reforecast.js

### L4 — Inline Editing with Auto-Save
Use defaultValue (uncontrolled) for text/date/number inputs — saves on blur.
Use value (controlled) for dropdowns — reflects optimistic updates immediately.
Optimistic updates: update local state immediately, save to Supabase, revert on error.
150ms blur delay on typeahead so onMouseDown fires before input closes.

### L5 — Print Stylesheets
Every structural element that might be shown/hidden in print must have a className.
@page rule must be outside @media print block.

### L6 — Reporting Month as Project-Level Setting (CRITICAL)
Never use new Date() as current month in any financial calculation.
Always use a user-controlled reporting_month stored on the project record.
reporting_month column on projects table (date, YYYY-MM-01).
ReportingMonthSelector component in every module header.

### L7 — RLS Recursion Risk
If RLS policies on any table reference that same table, infinite recursion occurs silently.
Fix: use simple user_id = auth.uid() policies.

### L8 — Supabase Steps Always Separate from Claude Code
Never embed SQL inside a Claude Code prompt.
Always give Supabase SQL steps in a separate clearly labeled block for manual execution.

## 19. LESSONS LEARNED FROM CORTINA BUILD

Apply these proactively — do not wait to rediscover them.

### L9 — RLS Anon Policies Needed for Every New Table and Operation
Every new table and every new operation type (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) requires an explicit anon RLS policy during development. Do not wait for a silent failure in the UI to discover a missing policy. After creating any new table, immediately add:
CREATE POLICY "anon_[table]_all" ON [table] FOR ALL TO anon USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
For production: replace anon policies with authenticated policies scoped by user_id or role.

### L10 — Generated Columns Cannot Be Included in INSERT or UPDATE
fee_line_items.total_hours and fee_line_items.line_total are GENERATED ALWAYS AS STORED columns.
Never include them in INSERT or UPDATE statements — Postgres will throw an error.
Always read them back after mutations using a SELECT or by reading the returned data.
Check 001_schema.sql for any column defined as GENERATED ALWAYS AS before writing to it.

### L11 — Enum Types Must Be Extended Before Writing New Values
When adding new values to a Postgres enum (e.g. scope_unit_enum), the UI build succeeds but every write fails with "invalid input value for enum" until ALTER TYPE is run in Supabase.
Always run ALTER TYPE [enum_name] ADD VALUE '[new_value]' before building UI that writes new enum values.
New values cannot be added inside a transaction — run each ADD VALUE as a separate statement.

### L12 — Scope Library DELETE Blocked by Foreign Key from fee_line_items
DELETE FROM scope_library fails when fee_line_items rows reference scope items via scope_item_id FK.
To reload scope library data: TRUNCATE TABLE fee_line_items first, then DELETE FROM scope_library.
Document dependency order for any data reset operation involving tables with FK relationships.

### L13 — Sort Order Needs a Dedicated Column from Day One
Relying on created_at for display order creates reordering problems later.
Any list that users might want to reorder needs a sort_order integer column from the start.
Pattern: sort_order integer, set on INSERT, updated via Promise.all on drag-to-reorder.
HTML5 drag and drop API handles reordering without any new npm packages.

### L14 — Firm-Wide Fields Stored Per-Row Require Bulk UPDATE
Rate Builder stores firm assumptions on every rate_cards row (one row per title stack).
When any firm assumption changes, UPDATE all affected rows simultaneously:
UPDATE rate_cards SET [field] = value WHERE rate_type = 'Role-Based'
Never update just one row when the field is conceptually firm-wide.
Consider whether a separate firm_settings table would be cleaner for future firm-wide config.

### L15 — Popover Calculation Inputs Need Their Own Storage Columns
If a calculation helper popover needs to show previous inputs on reopen, those inputs must be persisted to the database. React state is lost on page refresh and component remount.
Pattern: store calc_amount and calc_freq columns alongside the calculated result column.
Pre-fill the popover from stored values on open; save inputs alongside the result on Apply.

### L16 — Scope Library Data Reset Requires Clearing Dependent Tables First
When reloading seed data into scope_library, fee_line_items must be cleared first due to FK constraint.
Safe reset sequence: TRUNCATE TABLE fee_line_items; then DELETE FROM scope_library; then INSERT new data.
Always check for FK dependencies before running DELETE on any reference table.

### L17 — Rate Builder Architectural Pattern: Title Stacks + Firm Assumptions
The Rate Builder uses a hybrid architecture:
- Firm assumptions (bonus %, benefits, overhead rates) stored on every rate_card row identically
- Title-specific fields (salary, PTO, utilization, published rate) vary per row
- Calculated outputs (cost_per_hour, required_rate) stored on each row for reference
This pattern works for small firms but may need normalization (separate firm_assumptions table) as the product scales. Flag for future consideration.
